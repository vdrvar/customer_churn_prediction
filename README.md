# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in subscription-based services using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and customer behavior, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## Features
- Utilizes Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- Implements popular machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting.
- Includes data visualization techniques to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.
- Provides documentation and explanations for the codebase to aid understanding and future development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vdrvar/customer_churn_prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the `data/README.md` file.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, build models, and evaluate performance.
3. Modify the code and experiment with different algorithms or features to improve prediction accuracy.
4. Refer to the documentation and comments within the code for guidance and understanding.
